# Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals
## The Coursera Specialization contains 5 courses and takes approximately 150 hours in total.
The course includes software development with an introduction to Java, one of the most popular programming 
languages ​​and the basis of the Android operating system. This specialization is designed to teach the basic 
concepts of programming and how to write a program to solve complex problems. During the course, you get the 
basic skills necessary for a software engineer to solve real problems, from developing algorithms to testing 
and debugging programs.

## Java Programming Solving Problems with Software
Software is quickly becoming integral part of human life as we see more and more automation and technical advancements. Just like we expect car to work all the time and can't afford to break or reboot unexpectedly, software industry needs to continue to learn better way to build software if it were to become integral part of human life.

In this course,  you will get an overview of  how software teams work? What processes they use?  What are some of the industry standard methodologies? What are pros and cons of each?  You will learn enough to have meaningful conversation around software development processes.

After completing this course, a learner will be able to 
1) Apply core software engineering practices at conceptual level for a given problem. 
2) Compare and contrast traditional, agile, and lean development methodologies at high level.  These include Waterfall, Rational Unified Process, V model, Incremental, Spiral models and overview of agile mindset 
3) Propose a methodology best suited for a given situation

## Java Programming Solving Problems with Software
The course includes learning how to code in Java and improving your programming and problem solving skills. Teaches how to develop algorithms, as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open source classes, you can write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data.

After completing this course you will learn:
1. Edit, compile and run the Java program;
2. Use conditional statements and loops in a Java program;
3. Use the Java API documentation when writing programs.
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of program development;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; as well as
8. Use divide-and-conquer design methods for a program that uses multiple methods.

## Agile Software Development

After completing this course:
1) Demonstrate the ability to effectively participate in agile software development practices/processes.
2) Explain the purpose of the general flexibilities.
3) The ability to apply flexible principles and values ​​to a given situation.
4) The ability to identify and solve the most common problems that arise when implementing Agile methods.

## Lean Software Development
While scrum and XP were transforming the software development industry, there were another set of ideas (derived from lean manufacturing and Six Sigma) that started to influence software development methods. 
These ideas around Lean Software Development forms the foundation of number of agile methods. 

In this course, I covered the concepts of lean manufacturing and will cover some common lean methods and techniques such as kanban, value stream mapping, etc.
In this course, we also explored Lean Startup and Design Thinking techniques that can help a team learn about user and market needs much faster and cheaper.
