# Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals
## The Coursera Specialization contains 5 courses and takes approximately 150 hours in total.
The course includes software development with an introduction to Java, one of the most popular programming 
languages ​​and the basis of the Android operating system. This specialization is designed to teach the basic 
concepts of programming and how to write a program to solve complex problems. During the course, you get the 
basic skills necessary for a software engineer to solve real problems, from developing algorithms to testing 
and debugging programs.

## Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS
This course teaches basic programming concepts (eg functions, for loops, conditional statements) and how to solve problems like a programmer. In addition, the basics of web development are studied when creating web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. By the end of the course, you've created a web page where other users can upload their images and apply the image filters you've created.
After completing this course:
1. Think critically about how to solve a problem through programming;
2. Write JavaScript programs using functions, for loops and conditional statements;
3. Use HTML to create a web page with paragraphs, sections, images, links and lists;
4. Add styles to the web page with CSS IDs and classes; as well as
5. Make webpage interactive with JavaScript commands like alert, onClick, onChange by adding input features like image canvas, button and slider.

## Java Programming Solving Problems with Software
The course includes learning how to code in Java and improving your programming and problem solving skills. Teaches how to develop algorithms, as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open source classes, you can write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data.
After completing this course you will learn:
1. Edit, compile and run the Java program;
2. Use conditional statements and loops in a Java program;
3. Use the Java API documentation when writing programs.
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of program development;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; as well as
8. Use divide-and-conquer design methods for a program that uses multiple methods.

## Java Programming Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
Develop the software development skills learned in Java Programming: Solving Software Problems by learning new data structures. Use these data structures to create more complex programs that use Java's object-oriented features.
After completing this course:
1. Reading and writing data from / to files;
2. Solve problems with data files;
3. Conduct a quantitative analysis of the data (for example, find the maximums, minimums, averages);
4. Store and process data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine several classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterations and collections (including maps) in Java.

## Java Programming Principles of Software Design

This course solves real problems with Java using several classes. Learn how to build software solutions that scale with Java interfaces. By the end of this course, a program has been written that analyzes and sorts earthquake data, and a predictive text generator has been developed.

After completing this course:
1. Sorting is used correctly when solving problems;
2. Development of classes that implement the Comparable interface;
3. Uses time data to analyze empirical results;
4. Break problems into several classes, each with its own methods;
5. Determine whether a class from the Java API can be used to solve a specific problem;
6. Implement software solutions using multiple approaches and consider trade-offs;
7. Use object-oriented concepts, including interfaces and abstract classes, when developing programs;
8. Properly hide implementation decisions so that they are not visible in public methods; as well as
9. Recognize the limitations of Java algorithms and programs when solving problems.
10. Recognize standard Java classes and idioms, including exception handling, static methods, java.net and java.io packages.
