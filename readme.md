# Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals
## The Coursera Specialization contains 5 courses and takes approximately 150 hours in total.
The course includes software development with an introduction to Java, one of the most popular programming 
languages ​​and the basis of the Android operating system. This specialization is designed to teach the basic 
concepts of programming and how to write a program to solve complex problems. During the course, you get the 
basic skills necessary for a software engineer to solve real problems, from developing algorithms to testing 
and debugging programs.

## Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS
This course teaches basic programming concepts (eg functions, for loops, conditional statements) and how to solve problems like a programmer. In addition, the basics of web development are studied when creating web pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. By the end of the course, you've created a web page where other users can upload their images and apply the image filters you've created.
After completing this course:
1. Think critically about how to solve a problem through programming;
2. Write JavaScript programs using functions, for loops and conditional statements;
3. Use HTML to create a web page with paragraphs, sections, images, links and lists;
4. Add styles to the web page with CSS IDs and classes; as well as
5. Make webpage interactive with JavaScript commands like alert, onClick, onChange by adding input features like image canvas, button and slider.

## Java Programming Solving Problems with Software
The course includes learning how to code in Java and improving your programming and problem solving skills. Teaches how to develop algorithms, as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open source classes, you can write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data.

After completing this course you will learn:
1. Edit, compile and run the Java program;
2. Use conditional statements and loops in a Java program;
3. Use the Java API documentation when writing programs.
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of program development;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; as well as
8. Use divide-and-conquer design methods for a program that uses multiple methods.

## Java Programming Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data

After completing this course:
1. Reading and writing data from / to files;
2. Solve problems with data files;
3. Conduct a quantitative analysis of the data (for example, find the maximums, minimums, averages);
4. Store and process data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine several classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterations and collections (including maps) in Java.

## Lean Software Development
While scrum and XP were transforming the software development industry, there were another set of ideas (derived from lean manufacturing and Six Sigma) that started to influence software development methods. 
These ideas around Lean Software Development forms the foundation of number of agile methods. 

In this course, I covered the concepts of lean manufacturing and will cover some common lean methods and techniques such as kanban, value stream mapping, etc.
In this course, we also explored Lean Startup and Design Thinking techniques that can help a team learn about user and market needs much faster and cheaper.
